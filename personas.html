    Personas and Storyboarding
    </h1>
    <h2>
    Hello! This is my first UI/UX assignment. We were tasked with picking an interface and interviewing serveral users on their experience with it. We then created
    personas and a storyboard based on their responses.
    </h2>
    <h3>
    The interface I chose was Brown Dining. This interface is displayed throughout all the dining halls on campus on large screens, and students can also access it via their laptops and mobile devices.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Here is a basic sketch of what the interface looks like!

    <p> We were then tasked with interviewing 3 users on what their experience was using this interface for a variety of tasks. Here are the questions I asked these users:</p>

    <p> And here is a summary of their responses:</p>

    <p> From their responses, I then created two personas; one representing an experienced user, and the other an in-experienced user.</p>
    <img src="Persona 1.png">
    <img src="Persona 2.png">
    <p> Finally, I drew a storyboard representing one of the persona's experiences navigating the interface. I chose the experienced user.</p>
